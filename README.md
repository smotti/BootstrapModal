# Description

Tinkering with bootstrap and its modal component in elm. There's certainly
a more *elmish* way to do this but for a quick solution the JS-interop is
ok.

# Dependencies

* Elm

# Build

Just run:

```
$ build.sh
```

# Usage

After compiling the elm code to JS you can open up the **index.html** in
a browser of your choice.
